# mysql_test_db

The primary objective of this project is to develop a foundational understanding of several key technologies and processes in web development. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. Learn MySQL Server Setup: Gain practical experience in setting up and configuring a MySQL server, including database creation and table management.

2. Develop Skills in Node.js: Learn how to create and manage a Node.js project, which acts as the backend for the MySQL server. This involves understanding Node.js dependencies, environment configuration, and server setup.

3. Implement and Test CRUD APIs: Develop the skills to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs in Node.js, enabling interaction with the MySQL database.

4. Use Postman for API Testing: Learn how to use Postman, a popular tool for API testing, to validate the functionality of the CRUD APIs.

5. Handle Common SQL and Server Errors: Acquire the ability to troubleshoot and resolve typical SQL authentication errors and server configuration issues.

6. Project Integration and Testing: Integrate these components into a cohesive project, testing the full functionality from database setup to API implementation and validation.

This project is structured to provide hands-on experience, building a foundational skill set in web development, particularly focusing on backend technologies and database management.
